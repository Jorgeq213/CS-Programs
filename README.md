After having spent three years as a Computer Science Major at the University of Illinois at Chicago, I have spent so much of my time completing a lot of programs.
Some of them are simple games like 24, or weaver. Other more complicated games like hangman and baccarat, which was created using JavaFX, and JavaFXML.
Some of the most recent programs were two database app. One of them a CTA Database app, and the other is a Chicago Lobbyist app. Using SQL to collect the information from the Database, and python to output it.
While some of the intermedite were C++ programs like, Binary search trees, creating matrixes and modifying them. So I leave them here in this repsoitory so you can check out my work that I have completed.
